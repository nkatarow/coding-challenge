You can find the [demo here](http://challengeaccepted.nkatarow.net/), where you will find a full description of the project goals and requirements. Additionally, you will find a write up on each component and how it works. The codebase itself is also well commented.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
